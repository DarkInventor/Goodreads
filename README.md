# Goodreads
Hello Data Fam! As an avid reader, I often use Goodreads.com to search for books and read reviews. However, I often end up spoiling the book for myself due to reviews. So, I worked with the Goodreads dataset, containing 1.3M book reviews about 25,475 books and 18,892 users. After preprocessing the data and performing analytics using Python, Pandas, NumPy, JSON, and Matplotlib, I exported the JSON data of over 1.3M records to CSV and loaded it into Tableau to create a dashboard. My analysis shows the rating level increased steadily until 2016 and then started to decline. The spoiler ratio constantly increased until 2013. The highest ratings were in Jan 2017 with over 100k ratings. The highest spoilers were in Jul 2017, and with the coming years, a steep decline in ratings and a steady increase in spoilers were observed. Total reviews are 1,378,033, with an average calculated rating of 3.685. I'm still working on creating a machine learning pipeline to predict ratings from readers' reviews. #machinelearning #data #tableau #analytics #pandas #pipeline #py
